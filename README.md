We live in very exciting times ðŸ˜ƒ! BLDC motors are entering the hobby community more and more and many great projects have already emerged leveraging their far superior dynamics and power capabilities. BLDC motors have numerous advantages over regular DC motors but they have one big disadvantage, the complexity of control. Even though it has become relatively easy to design and manufacture PCBs and create our own hardware solutions for driving BLDC motors the proper low-cost solutions are yet to come. One of the reasons for this is the apparent complexity of writing the BLDC driving algorithms, Field oriented control (FOC) being an example of one of the most efficient ones.
The solutions that can be found on-line are almost exclusively very specific for certain hardware configuration and the microcontroller architecture used.
Additionally, most of the efforts at this moment are still channeled towards the high-power applications of the BLDC motors and proper low-cost and low-power FOC supporting boards are very hard to find today and even may not exist. <br>
Therefore this is an attempt to: 
- ðŸŽ¯ Demystify FOC algorithm and make a robust but simple Arduino library: [Arduino *SimpleFOClibrary*](https://docs.simplefoc.com/arduino_simplefoc_library_showcase)
  - <i>Support as many <b>motor + sensor + driver + mcu</b> combinations out there</i>
- ðŸŽ¯ Develop modular and easy to use FOC supporting BLDC driver boards
   - For official driver boards see [<span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Boards</span>](https://docs.simplefoc.com/boards)
   - Many many more boards developed by the community members, see [<span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Community</span>](https://community.simplefoc.com/)

> NEXT RELEASE ðŸ“¢ : <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> v2.3.5
> - Motor characterization code thanks to @mcells
> - Bugfix for ESP32 C6 thanks to @kondor1622
> - See the complete list of bugfixes and new features of v2.3.5 [fixes and PRs](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC/milestone/12)

## Getting Started
Depending on if you want to use this library as the plug and play Arduino library or you want to get insight in the algorithm and make changes there are two ways to install this code.

- Full library installation [Docs](https://docs.simplefoc.com/library_download)
- PlatformIO [Docs](https://docs.simplefoc.com/library_platformio)

### Arduino *SimpleFOClibrary* installation to Arduino IDE
#### Arduino Library Manager 
The simplest way to get hold of the library is directly by using Arduino IDE and its integrated Library Manager. 
- Open Arduino IDE and start Arduino Library Manager by clicking: `Tools > Manage Libraries...`.
- Search for `Simple FOC` library and install the latest version.
- Reopen Arduino IDE and you should have the library examples in `File > Examples > Simple FOC`.

#### Using Github website 
- Go to the [github repository](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC)
- Click first on `Clone or Download > Download ZIP`. 
- Unzip it and place it in `Arduino Libraries` folder. Windows: `Documents > Arduino > libraries`.  
- Reopen Arduino IDE and you should have the library examples in `File > Examples > Simple FOC`.

#### Using terminal
- Open terminal and run
```sh  
cd #Arduino libraries folder
git clone https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC.git
```
- Reopen Arduino IDE and you should have the library examples in `File > Examples > Simple FOC`.

## Arduino code example
This is a simple Arduino code example implementing the velocity control program of a BLDC motor with encoder. 

NOTE: This program uses all the default control parameters.

```cpp
#include <SimpleFOC.h>

//  BLDCMotor( pole_pairs )
BLDCMotor motor = BLDCMotor(11);
//  BLDCDriver( pin_pwmA, pin_pwmB, pin_pwmC, enable (optional) )
BLDCDriver3PWM driver = BLDCDriver3PWM(9, 10, 11, 8);
//  Encoder(pin_A, pin_B, CPR)
Encoder encoder = Encoder(2, 3, 2048);
// channel A and B callbacks
void doA(){encoder.handleA();}
void doB(){encoder.handleB();}


void setup() {  
  // initialize encoder hardware
  encoder.init();
  // hardware interrupt enable
  encoder.enableInterrupts(doA, doB);
  // link the motor to the sensor
  motor.linkSensor(&encoder);
  
  // power supply voltage [V]
  driver.voltage_power_supply = 12;
  // initialise driver hardware
  driver.init();
  // link driver
  motor.linkDriver(&driver);

  // set control loop type to be used
  motor.controller = MotionControlType::velocity;
  // initialize motor
  motor.init();
  
  // align encoder and start FOC
  motor.initFOC();
}

void loop() {
  // FOC algorithm function
  motor.loopFOC();

  // velocity control loop function
  // setting the target velocity or 2rad/s
  motor.move(2);
}
```
